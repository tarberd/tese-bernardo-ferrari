# Minute from 2020-11-24

## What have I done:

1. Finished writing the introduction draft including motivation; goals; and a brief explanation of the work;

## Problems I am having

1. Difficulty narrowing down, background should include lexer, parser theory?
2. Probably operational semantics;
3. Material on type systems with predicates.

## For next week

1. Have the body of the background sorted;
2. Fix proposed changes by Alcides on the introduction.
