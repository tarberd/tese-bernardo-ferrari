# Minute from 2020-11-17

## What have I done (or things I should have done sooner):

1. Get the template for the preliminary report of my thesis;
2. Remember how to compile latex;
3. Start to translate introduction to English;
3. Get supervisor Alcides Fonseca on the thesis system as "co-orientador";
4. Understand the evaluation of the preliminary report as follows:
    * Need to invite between 3 to 5 jury members with at least a Bachelors degree;
    * If written in English, all members of the jury must approve with a email message;
    * To succeed with the preliminary report, all members of the jury must approve the preliminary report.
5. Invite home professor "Jerusa Marchi" to the jury.


## Problems I am having

1. My old "orientador" Rafael de Santiago whats to get out of the hole of "orientador" and put Alcides Fonseca instead, and set his hole as "Professor responsavel";
2. I need 1 more member of the jury;

## For next week

1. Have all things sorted on the thesis system of my home university;
2. Have my preliminary report structured with all necessary sections;
