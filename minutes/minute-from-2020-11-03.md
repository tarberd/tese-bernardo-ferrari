# Minute from 2020-11-03

## What have I done:

Write a draft implementation of the type checker for the operational semantics proposed on the 27th.
Prohibit functions inside functions.
Implement return statements.

## Problems I'm having

1. Errors are handled with panic.
2. AST nodes have no token data for error message.

## Next Weak

1. Start implementing some refinements?
2. Improve lexer token info and AST nodes info.
