  abstract  = {A type system is a syntactic method for automatically checking the absence of certain
               erroneous behaviors by classifying program phrases according to the kinds of values
               they compute. The study of type systems -- and of programming languages from a type-theoretic
               perspective -- has important applications in software engineering, language design,
               high-performance compilers, and security. This text provides a comprehensive introduction
               both to type systems in computer science and to the basic theory of programming languages.
               The approach is pragmatic and operational; each new concept is motivated by programming
               examples and the more theoretical sections are driven by the needs of implementations.
               Each chapter is accompanied by numerous exercises and solutions, as well as a running
               implementation, available via the Web. Dependencies between chapters are explicitly
               identified, allowing readers to choose a variety of paths through the material. The
               core topics include the untyped lambda-calculus, simple type systems, type reconstruction,
               universal and existential polymorphism, subtyping, bounded quantification, recursive
               types, kinds, and type operators. Extended case studies develop a variety of approaches
               to modeling the features of object-oriented languages.},

  abstract    = {This classic book on formal languages, automata theory, and computational complexity has been updated to present theoretical concepts in a concise and straightforward manner with the increase of hands-on, practical applications. This new edition comes with Gradiance, an online assessment tool developed for computer science. Gradiance is the most advanced online assessment tool developed for the computer science discipline. With its innovative underlying technology, Gradiance turns basic homework assignments and programming labs into an interactive learning experience for students. By using a series of root questions and hints, it not only tests a student's capability, but actually simulates a one-on-one teacher-student tutorial that allows for the student to more easily learn the material. Through the programming labs, instructors are capable of testing, tracking, and honing their students' skills, both in terms of syntax and semantics, with an unprecedented level of assessment never before offered.},
