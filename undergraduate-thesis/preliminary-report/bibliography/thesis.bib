  abstract  = {A type system is a syntactic method for automatically checking the absence of certain
               erroneous behaviors by classifying program phrases according to the kinds of values
               they compute. The study of type systems -- and of programming languages from a type-theoretic
               perspective -- has important applications in software engineering, language design,
               high-performance compilers, and security. This text provides a comprehensive introduction
               both to type systems in computer science and to the basic theory of programming languages.
               The approach is pragmatic and operational; each new concept is motivated by programming
               examples and the more theoretical sections are driven by the needs of implementations.
               Each chapter is accompanied by numerous exercises and solutions, as well as a running
               implementation, available via the Web. Dependencies between chapters are explicitly
               identified, allowing readers to choose a variety of paths through the material. The
               core topics include the untyped lambda-calculus, simple type systems, type reconstruction,
               universal and existential polymorphism, subtyping, bounded quantification, recursive
               types, kinds, and type operators. Extended case studies develop a variety of approaches
               to modeling the features of object-oriented languages.}
